## Iteration 1: Database Integration with Prisma

**Date**: March 20, 2023

### Changes Made:
1. Initialized Prisma with SQLite database
2. Created database schema with the following models:
   - User (integrated with NextAuth)
   - Account (for OAuth providers)
   - Session (for managing user sessions)
   - Chat (for storing chat history)
   - HealthReport (for future implementation)
3. Set up Prisma Client for database access
4. Updated NextAuth configuration to use PrismaAdapter

### Technical Details:
- Used SQLite for simplicity and ease of deployment
- Implemented a reusable Prisma client pattern to optimize connections
- Created relationship between User and Chat models for personalized chat history
- Added session callback to include user ID in the session object

### Challenges:
- Resolving type conflicts between NextAuth session types and database types
- Ensuring proper error handling for database operations
- Managing asynchronous database operations in the chat flow

### Next Steps:
1. Implement chat history UI components
2. Create chat history page for viewing past conversations
3. Add chat persistence in the chat API
4. Test the full authentication and chat history flow

## Iteration 2: Chat User Interface and Persistence

**Date**: March 20, 2023

### Changes Made:
1. Created ChatHistory component for displaying user's past conversations

4. Updated chat API to save conversations in the database
5. Added navigation to access chat history

### Technical Details:
- Used React hooks for state management in chat components
- Implemented chat title generation from first message
- Added optimistic updates for chat deletion
- Created responsive UI with Tailwind CSS

### UI Improvements:
- Dark theme consistent with the rest of the application
- Loading states for asynchronous operations
- Empty states for new users
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

### Next Steps:
1. Add health report upload and storage in the database
2. Implement health trends visualization
3. Enhance chat experience with typing indicators
4. Add chat search functionality

## Iteration 3: Future Work - Health Data Integration

**Ideas for next iteration:**
- Store parsed health data in structured format
- Link health reports to specific chat conversations
- Implement health data visualization with trend analysis
- Create shareable health reports for healthcare providers
